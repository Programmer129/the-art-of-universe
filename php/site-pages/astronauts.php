                In 1934, scientist Carl Sagan was born in Brooklyn, N.Y.
                After earning bachelor and master's degrees at Cornell,
                Sagan earned a double doctorate at the University of Chicago in 1960.
                He became professor of astronomy and space science and director of the Laboratory
                for Planetary Studies at Cornell University, and co-founder of the Planetary Society.
                A great popularizer of science, Sagan produced the PBS series, "Cosmos,"
                which was Emmy and Peabody award-winning, and was watched by 500 million people in 60 countries.
                A book of the same title came out in 1980, and was on The New York Times bestseller list for 7 weeks.
                Sagan was author, co-author or editor of 20 books, including The Dragons of Eden (1977),
                which won a Pulitzer, Pale Blue Dot (1995) and The Demon-Haunted World: Science As a Candle in the Dark
                (1996),
                his hardest-hitting on religion. With his wife, Ann Druyan,
                he was co-producer of the popular motion picture, "Contact,"
                which featured a feminist, atheist protagonist played by Jodie Foster (1997).
                The film came out after Sagan's death, following a 2-year struggle with a bone marrow disease .
                Sagan played a leading role in NASA's Mariner, Viking,
                Voyager, and Galileo expeditions to other planets.
                Ann Druyan, in the epilogue to Sagan's last book, Billions and Billions:
                Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium (published posthumously in 1997),
                gives a moving account of Carl's last days: "Contrary to the fantasies of the fundamentalists,
                there was no deathbed conversion, no last minute refuge taken in a comforting vision of a heaven or an
                afterlife.
                For Carl, what mattered most was what was true, not merely what would make us feel better.
                Even at this moment when anyone would be forgiven for turning away from the reality of our situation,
                Carl was unflinching. As we looked deeply into each other's eyes,
                it was with a shared conviction that our wondrous life together was ending forever."

                On April 12, 1961, at 9:07 a.m. Moscow time,
                the Vostok 1 spacecraft blasted off from the Soviets' launch site.
                Because no one was certain how weightlessness would affect a pilot,
                the spherical capsule had little in the way of onboard controls; the work was
                done either automatically or from the ground. If an emergency arose, Gagarin was
                supposed to receive an override code that would allow him to take manual control,
                but Sergei Korolov, chief designer of the Soviet space program, disregarded
                protocol and gave it to the pilot prior to the flight.
                <br/>

                Over the course of 108 minutes, Vostok 1 traveled around the Earth once,
                reaching a maximum height of 203 miles (327 kilometers). Over Africa,
                the engines fired to bring Gagarin back to Earth. The craft carried ten
                days worth of provisions in case the engines failed and Gagarin was required
                to wait for the orbit to naturally decay, but they were unnecessary. Gagarin
                re-entered Earth's atmosphere, experiencing forces up to eight times the pull of
                gravity, but remained consciousness.
                <br/>

                Vostok 1 had no engines to slow its re-entry or a way to land safely.
                About four miles up (seven kilometers), Gagarin ejected and parachuted to Earth.
                In order for the mission to be counted as an official spaceflight, the Fédération
                Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the governing body for aerospace records,
                had determined that the pilot must land with the spacecraft. Soviet leaders
                indicated that Gagarin had touched down with the Vostok 1, and did not reveal
                that he had ejected until 1971. Regardless, Gagarin still set the record as the
                first man to leave Earth's orbit and travel into space. [Milestones in Human

                More than 200 Russian Air Force fighter pilots were selected as cosmonaut candidates.
                Such pilots were considered optimum because they had exposure to the forces of
                acceleration and the ejection process, as well as experience with high-stress situations.
                Among the pilots was 27-year-old Senior Lieutenant Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin.
                <br/>

                The third of four children, Gagarin was born on March 9, 1934, in a small village a
                hundred miles from Moscow. As a teenager, Gagarin witnessed a Russian Yak fighter
                plane make an emergency landing near his home. When offered a chance years later to
                join a flying club, he eagerly accepted, making his first solo flight in 1955. Only a
                few years later, he submitted his request to be considered as a cosmonaut.
                <br/>

                The American plan to send a man into space by 1961 created a deadline
                that the Russian team worked hard to beat. The development of the Vostok spacecraft
                became paramount. Prior to Gagarin’s historic flight, the Soviets sent a prototype of
                his spaceship, along with a life-size dummy called Ivan Ivanovich and a dog called Zvezdochka.
                With these successes, the vessel was considered ready to take a living, breathing human into space.
